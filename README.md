# 🌱 Cropnosis – AI-Powered Lettuce Disease Detection

Cropnosis is a mobile application that utilizes **deep learning** and **computer vision** to detect lettuce diseases from images. By leveraging a **CNN-based model**, the app helps farmers and agriculturists diagnose plant health efficiently and take early action to prevent crop loss.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **AI-Powered Disease Detection** – Snap or upload an image to identify lettuce diseases.  
✅ **Real-Time Analysis** – Get instant results with AI-based classification.  
✅ **Mobile-Friendly** – Built with **React Native** and **Expo** for cross-platform support.  
✅ **Modern UI** – Styled with **TailwindCSS** for a sleek and responsive experience.  
✅ **Database Integration** – Uses **PostgreSQL** for storing disease data and user records.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** PostgreSQL, Node.js (Express)
- **AI Model:** Custom-trained CNN for lettuce disease classification
- **Cloud Storage:** TBD (AWS/GCP/Firebase)
- **State Management:** TBD (Context API/Redux/Zustand)

## 📷 How It Works

1. Capture or upload an image of lettuce leaves.
2. Cropnosis preprocesses the image and sends it to the trained CNN model.
3. The model predicts the disease (if any) and provides recommendations.
4. View disease history and insights in the app.

## 🤖 Model Training

- The CNN model is trained using **labeled lettuce disease datasets**.
- Built with **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch**.
- Training scripts and dataset preprocessing will be included in `model/` directory.

## 📌 Roadmap

- [ ] Train and optimize CNN model
- [ ] Implement backend API with PostgreSQL
- [ ] Develop and test React Native UI
- [ ] Integrate AI model with mobile app
- [ ] Deploy the app to **Google Play Store & App Store**
